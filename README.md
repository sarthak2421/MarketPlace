# MarketPlace
A simple WebApp implemented in HTML, CSS, Flask, SQLAlchemy Database.

Libraries with versions that I have used : 
flask : 3.0.2
flask-sqlalchemy : 3.1.1
flask-bcrypt : 1.0.1
flask-login : 0.6.3

This Flask app serves as a fundamental practice platform, primarily emphasizing backend development. While currently basic, it provides ample room for future expansion and implementation of additional features.

To run the app, you need to run the file 'run.py'.
